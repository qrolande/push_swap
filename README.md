# push_swap

Sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves.

Use "make" to compile push_swap file -> ./push_swap 5 4 3 2 1 -> push_swap must sort it in less steps way

Use "make bonus" to compile checker file -> ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG -> The checker should return "OK" if the sorting is correct and "KO" if the sorting is not correct.
